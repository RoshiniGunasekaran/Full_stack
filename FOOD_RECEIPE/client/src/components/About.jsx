            <p>
              At Foodie AI, we aim to bring technology and delicious food together! Using advanced AI technology, our platform helps you identify the food in front of you just by uploading a picture. Whether it's your favorite dish from a restaurant or a home-cooked meal, our AI will analyze the image and provide you with a list of possible recipes that you can try at home.
